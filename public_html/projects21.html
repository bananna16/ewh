                        complete motor limitations in their upper body. Cerebral palsy is one of the most common causes of spastic paralysis, 
                        affecting about 1 in 323 children according to estimates from CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring 
                        (ADDM) Network. It is also the most common motor disability in childhood and results in increased muscle tone and stiffness, 
                        which can create jerky movements in the limbs. This is often treated with physical therapy and braces, which can be very 
                        expensive and not available in low resource communities. </p>

                        a device that allows for shoulder print anteroposterior and lateral movements sliding on a rail. The arm of the user could be 
                        placed on the device, on a table. A purely mechanical device would eliminate the need for electricity.</p>

                      <p><br>Parasitic infections such as soil-transmitted helminths affect about 24% of the world’s population. They are mostly prevalent in 
                      warm and humid climates with poor sanitation and hygiene problems. They are considered one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), as 
                      they are extremely prevalent and cause extreme disability and suffering, but can be treated. Heavier infections can lead to malnutrition, 
                      intestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, anemia, impaired growth, among other symptoms.  They are transmitted by passing 
                      on the parasitic eggs through the feces, and since most places predominantly affected by these conditions lack sanitation, such infections 
                      can be transmitted through contaminated vegetables, water, and through contaminated soil. While treatment is extremely low-cost, there is a 
                      limitation to the diagnosis of such conditions as they require hiring trained microscopists to analyze stool samples. Therefore, by creating 
                      a software that can diagnose these infections by analysing images, the cost of diagnosis decreases significantly.</p>

                      <p><br>While there may be multiple approaches to this project, the main idea revolves around coding an artificial intelligence neural 
                      network (convolutional neural network) to identify parasitic eggs in fecal matter. This could be done by processing images of positive and 
                      negative diagnoses so that the program is able to recognize the pattern used for diagnosis of parasitic infections. Furthermore, other 
                      components could be added to help with diagnosis, such as a microscope attachment for inputting information into the software, or even 
                      building a portable smart microscope so that this technology can be applied to remote areas.</p>

                      <p><br>Preterm birth is the leading cause of death for children under five years old. Nearly three quarters of them could be saved with 
                        current interventions. The disparity in survival rates of preterm babies based on a country’s wealth is startling. In high-income 
                        countries, almost all of the babies born after 32 weeks survive, but in low-income communities, only half survive. Birth Asphyxia 
                        is a significant contributing factor and lack of access to resuscitation practices in developing countries contributes to 23% of 
                        neonatal deaths, but also contributes greatly to the 3 billion documented stillbirths that occur annually. Birth asphyxia, defined as 
                        a newborn’s failure to initiate and/or sustain normal breathing and oxygenation, accounts for roughly one-quarter (21%–28%) of all 
                        neonatal deaths, many of which are misclassified as stillbirths. There are simple resuscitation techniques and equipment that, if 
                        implemented, can prevent most deaths by birth asphyxia.

                      <p><br>There are many approaches to this problem, some of which include a mobile app or website that could facilitate neonatal resuscitation 
                        training through the use of illustrations and feedback, a low cost, portable bag and mask ventilator/ stethoscope kit to avoid stillbirth 
                        misdiagnosis and perform resuscitation, or an add-on training device for the existing bag valve mask resuscitator. The add-on device would 
                        monitor and record resuscitation performance, thus providing real-time and objective feedback regarding the user’s ventilation technique. 
                        It would be able to measure airway pressure and flow. The use of an algorithm to identify common ventilation errors, including face-mask 
                        leakage, airway obstruction, incorrect rate, or excessive ventilation pressure could also be a path for this project. A combination of these 
                        ideas could also be an option.

                      <p><br> In 2018, 34.2 million Americans, or 10.5% of the population, had diabetes. The United States and Mexico are the leading countries 
                        in diabetes prevalence, affecting around 14% of Mexicans. Diabetes has also been shown to be more prevalent in low-income communities 
                        due to the correlation between cost and food quality. Currently, one of the largest struggles for people with diabetes in local low 
                        resource communities is the lack of information and resources for non-native speakers and immigrants. Besides glucose monitors and 
                        mobile apps being somewhat inaccessible due to cost, there is a need for monitoring applications that are targeted for immigrant communities. </p>

                      <p><br>The idea is to create a mobile application that monitors different vitals and symptoms and gives the patient simple and relevant 
                        information that would help them understand their disease and take proper preventative care. A mobile-eye test that could detect vision 
                        loss could be an extra feature for this product. A key aspect of this solution is to create something that will be accepted, understood and 
                        used by the target community, so close attention to the connection between healthcare and different cultures and languages will be vital. 
                        Although there are some low cost applications out there, they often fail to address the issues that these communities face, as well as fail 
                        to communicate information appropriately.

                      <p><br>This project is going to work alongside Champions for Health, San Diego County Medical Society Foundation, who strive to provide medical 
                        care to adults that are uninsured, underinsured, or with limited access to care and preventative services. Therefore, the target community will 
                        be chosen with the help of ethnographic research done through the organization’s contacts and resources.
