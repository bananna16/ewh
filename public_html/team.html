              <b>Major:</b> Bioengineering: BioSystems<br>
              <b>Minor:</b> Global Health <br><br>
              I joined EWH as a freshman looking for practical engineering skills like CAD and project management. During that 
              first year, I did learn a lot of new skills, but I also fell in love with the people in the org, the challenges our 
              project teams had to overcome, and the focus on global health. EWH is a space that has fueled my interest in learning 
              more about health disparities and how medical devices can be developed to help lessen these disparities.  <br>
              My positive experiences have kept me coming back year after year! EWH has brought so many great experiences, lessons and 
              people into my life and I'd like to help bring those opportunities to other students. <br><br>
              When I have free time, I like to read (sci-fi, fantasy and historical fiction mostly), bake goodies to share with friends, 
              and listen to music (just about any genre, but I especially love musicals!). I'm always looking for fellow musical fans 
              so please be my friend and talk musicals with me >.< <br>
              I am a huge fan of Jeopardy! My favorite part about visiting home is getting cable access so I can watch it live every 
              weeknight at 7pm. I have too much useless trivia knowledge floating around in my brain.....

              I first heard about EWH during my freshman year orientation, where a few clubs were tabling and introducing themselves 
              to new students. I already knew that I wanted to join a club or org during my freshman year not only because 
              I wanted to be involved at UCSD and contribute in some form, but also because coming from a small high school, I was 
              anxious about meeting new people and making friends. I was instantly intrigued with EWH's mission to improve healthcare 
              in the developing world by educating and inspiring the biomedical community, because the main reason I am at UCSD is 
              to gain an education that gives me the skills and the platform to contribute to the world in a meaningful manner. So 
              I joined EWH so I would be able to work on projects to improve global health, while still making lifelong friends and 
              learning useful practical skills in the process. <br><br>
              Whenever I have free time, I like to play guitar, watch tv shows with friends, or learn how to cook something new. I have 
              a terrible sense of direction, so I tend to get lost occasionally but luckily it's slowly improving. My favorite food 
              are potatoes because of how versatile they so you can make a variety of potato dishes and never be bored! I'm also 
              weirdly skilled at finding things on Google, so hit me up if you ever need help finding a video/website/paper to help 
              with class :D

              I joined EWH in my freshman year looking for a way to meet friends and work on my resume. I absolutely love the 
              EWH community. The retreats we've gone on have always been fun in really unexpected ways, whether we end up foraging for 
              wood to start a bonfire or struggle to draw things together in pictionary. I also have gotten to really stretch my 
              technical skills through the projects I've been in. The previous year I was part of a project team working on machine 
              learning, which I had very little experience in. I ended the year having a really solid addition to my resume, as well 
              as learning very applicable skills. <br><br>
              I really enjoy reading. Terry Pratchett is my favorite author and I'm eagerly awaiting my chance to read the new entry in 
              the Stormlight Archive. One book which I found surprisingly interesting was The Autobiography of Malcolm X, which is not 
              nearly as dry as it sounds. It's more of a captivating novel than a dry retelling of historical events.

              I love reading and napping. Anything outdoors or sporty, such as rock climbing, biking, snowboarding, etc. I love any sort

               Mexico, I ran the NYC Marathon in 2019 and I have travelled to more than 20 countries.

              I joined EWH my first quarter at UCSD because I wanted to apply my technical skills to real-world projects. I found 
              EWH to be the perfect combination of engineering and public health: two disciplines I'm really interested in! I was 
              able to work with a great team and I really enjoyed working on an engineering project and learning how to use many 
              of the tools in EnVision. I love being able to not only work on my practical skills but also on my soft skills such 
              as teamwork, communication, and networking! <br><br>
              During quarantine, I've been playing a lot of video games, getting back into reading, watching Netflix, baking, 
              and hiking! Usually, I also play soccer and board games with my friends.
