                      4 billion cases of diarrhoea occur annually, of which 88% is attributable to unsafe water, and inadequate sanitation 
                      and hygiene. WHO estimates that 94% of diarrhoeal cases are preventable through modifications to the environment, 
                      including through interventions to increase the availability of clean water, and to improve sanitation and hygiene. </p>

                      <p><br>There are many possible methods to use to create a portable water filter. For example, chemical methods such 
                      as using activated carbon work via absorbing harmful particles. Others, such as membrane filters function by excluding 
                      particles that are too large. Additionally, methods such as UV filters actually kill harmful organisms in the water. 
                      There are other more complex methods to consider as well. For example, it could be possible to harness bacteria to 
                      clean water even further. Ideally, the team would combine multiple methods, and would aim to design low-cost alternatives 
                      for mass produced items such as the membrane filters or activated charcoal systems.</p>

                      <p><br>The transportation and storage of vaccines poses a logistic and financial challenge for many low-resource settings 
                      due to a lack of electricity. Therefore, low-resource communities have diminished access to vaccines, which increases exposure 
                      to preventable diseases. Currently, some immunization programs use frozen packs to maintain the temperature of vaccines, but 
                      this may cause the vaccines to freeze and become unusable. A cold chain system allows for the storage and transportation of vaccines 
                      at the recommended temperatures from manufacturing to use.</p>

                      the cold chain vaccine storage system. The device must be able to account for inadequate facilities and capacity, minimize the 
                      risk of freezing the vaccines, and withstand long-distance transport. Potential solutions for this problem include creating evaporative 
                      cooling systems, highly-insulated containers or long-term cooling technologies that allow for the maintenance of the potency of vaccines.</p>

                      <p><br>Preterm birth is the leading cause of death for children under five years old. Nearly three quarters of them could be 
                      saved with current interventions. The disparity in survival rates of preterm babies based on a country’s wealth is startling. 
                      In high-income countries, almost all of the babies born after 32 weeks survive, but in low-income communities, only half survive. 
                      Hypothermia is a significant factor contributing to the death of preterm babies. Infant incubators are commonly used in neonatal 
                      care units to help preterm infants maintain safe body temperature. Such equipment costs thousands of dollars and requires a stable 
                      source of electricity to operate. Even though some are donated to these low-income hospitals they stay unused given their unreliable 
                      electricity.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="warmer-pills-scope" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="warmer-pills-scope-tab">
                      <p><br>The idea is to create a portable device that is capable of maintaining the infant at approximately body temperature without 
                      having to be continuously connected to an electricity source. In this project the use of phase-changing materials can be used to 
                      regulate the temperature of the blanket without losing energy in the process. These materials have the ability to solidify and liquify 
                      at a specific temperature avoiding the loss of heat and energy. The material would still have to be heated from time to time but it 
                      would be able to keep a certain temperature for a long period of time. This can be built as a small sleeping bag for the baby with 
                      compartments where the technology can be inserted. Other materials and ways of heating the pads can be used.</p>

                      <p><br>Falling is the fifth leading cause of death among adults older than 65. In a study of 1,103 people older than 72, nearly 50% 
                      experienced at least one fall in the past 2-5 years. Among them, approximately 25% experienced serious injuries and 5% experienced 
                      fracture. According to a large study of older adults seeking emergency care after a fall, 2.2% of injurious fall results in immediate 
                      death. Despite falling being a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, causes of falls are often neglected during a 
                      medical visit, as both healthcare providers and patients believe that failing is an inevitable process accompanied by aging. Even when 
                      clinical action is taken, the intervention programs to prevent falling can be inefficient or expensive.</p>

                      <p><br>By harvesting the energy from human foot strike, a shoe insole can be created that uses the electric signals from a foot strike 
                      to send information that can be processed and used in gait analysis. This can identify gait disorders early on, and provide a preventative 
                      solution to the high rate of elderly falls. The user of the gait analysis shoe does not have to physically meet any doctor, so the care 
                      can be done remotely. After the shoe takes in data from the person walking, this data is sent wirelessly to the doctor to analyze. 
                      Piezo-electric steps or other sensory type devices can be placed into the insole to analyze the footstep and compare it to a “normal” 
                      footstep. </p>

                      <p><br>Parasitic infections such as soil-transmitted helminths affect about 24% of the world’s population. They are mostly prevalent in 
                      warm and humid climates with poor sanitation and hygiene problems. They are considered one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), as 
                      they are extremely prevalent and cause extreme disability and suffering, but can be treated. Heavier infections can lead to malnutrition, 
                      intestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, anemia, impaired growth, among other symptoms.  They are transmitted by passing 
                      on the parasitic eggs through the feces, and since most places predominantly affected by these conditions lack sanitation, such infections 
                      can be transmitted through contaminated vegetables, water, and through contaminated soil. While treatment is extremely low-cost, there is a 
                      limitation to the diagnosis of such conditions as they require hiring trained microscopists to analyze stool samples. Therefore, by creating 
                      a software that can diagnose these infections by analysing images, the cost of diagnosis decreases significantly.</p>

                      <p><br>While there may be multiple approaches to this project, the main idea revolves around coding an artificial intelligence neural 
                      network (convolutional neural network) to identify parasitic eggs in fecal matter. This could be done by processing images of positive and 
                      negative diagnoses so that the program is able to recognize the pattern used for diagnosis of parasitic infections. Furthermore, other 
                      components could be added to help with diagnosis, such as a microscope attachment for inputting information into the software, or even 
                      building a portable smart microscope so that this technology can be applied to remote areas.</p>

                      <p><br>Use in elementary schools, where treatment for parasitic infections is most often administered. Since about 24% of the world’s 
                      population is affected by these diseases, possible areas of focus include sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, China, and East Asia.</p>
